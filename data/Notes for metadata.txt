*Notes for metadata*

bulk_density
- The small cores were 4.9 cm diameter X 5.1 cm deep, thus:
V = π r2 h
V = π (2.46^2) (5.1) = 96.96 cm3

- The larger cores from the first three burns were 5 cm diameter x 13 cm deep
V = π (2.5^2) (13) = 255.25 cm3
- Originally, the soil volume was incorrect, so now the true bulk density in the 11th column (K) called "Correct bulk density"

rdm_fireintensity_soilmoisture
- rdm pre-burn for all sites
- soil moisture for all sites
- fire intensity tags - none for 2023 burns (AM, CF, WR22)
- rdm post-burn for 2024 burns
(missing WR13_C_B_T2 - 30 ; also don't have them for WR5_B_T5 for 15, 30, and 45 since this site didn't end up burning

root_biomass
- Year (2024) 
- Site (MF, WR5, WR13, CSR, TKR, PL)
- Transect_ID (MF_B_T1)
- Treatment (Burn, Control)
- Transect (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
- Sample (15, 30, 45)
- Roots_g_per_m2 (dry weight * 509.295817894)
The volume of each soil core (5 cm diameter, 15 cm length) was 294.52 cm^3 ; V = π r2 h or V = π (2.5 x 2.5)(15). Root biomass per unit of ground area (g/m^2) from V = A d or V = (100 cm)(100cm)(15 cm) = 150,000 cm^3. Thus, each core sample represents 294.52 cm^3 of 150,000 cm^3. To convert dry roots to g/m^2, we multiplied dry weight (g) by the inverse of the fraction (150,000/294.52) to get the root biomass of each sample (Roots_g_per_m2).
- TKR_B_T5 (45) is missing a sample

soil_C_N_2023
- Only for 2023 burns (AM, WR22, and CF)
- For AM, we sent in four samples per transect (10, 20, 30, 40 m) both for before and after the burn ; syntax (AM-B-T1-10 for pre and AM-A-T1-10 for post)
- Also use the -C-B format for controls (AM-C-B-T1-10)
- For WR22 (called WR in this dataset) and CF, we sent in one composite sample per transect from the 10, 20, 30, and 40 m samples (WR_B_T1_1to4) ; also for controls (WR_C_B_T1_1to4) both pre (_B) and post (_A)

soil_C_N_2024
- Only have T1 and T2 for PL_C
- Sample location needs to be broken up to being Transect, Sample, Time (PL_B_T1_15_pre should be Transect: PL_B_T1, Sample: 15, and Time: pre ; Include new column called Treatment : Burn/Control, where _C is Control and _B is Burn
- Only post soil sample for Treatment = Burn

soil_nutrients
- 2023 burns (AM, WR22, and CF) had four soil samples per transect (10, 20, 30, 40-m). These were homogenized and sent in for soil soil nutrients (1 per transect). The annotation is AM_B_T1_1to4
- This is also done for the controls: AM_C_B_T1_1to4
- 2024 burns have three samples per transect (15, 30, 45) that were measured separately ; the syntax is PL_B_T1_15_pre
- 2024 burns in the control for whatever reason don't have the _pre in the Sample Location, but they were sampled pre-burn ; syntax is PL_C_T1_15 (not C_B_ like the 2023 burns)
- Only have WR_B_T5_15_pre -- should remove since it didn't burn 
- Didn't end up using MC (Molino Creek) - can remove this site for all Sample Location
- Crystal Springs is CSR_SC -- eventually just make it CSR
- Post-burn soil nutrients for 2024 burns, which includes _post ; syntax is PL_B_T1_15_post

soil_texture
- % Sand, % Clay, % Silt using the hydrometer method
- Get rid of AM-B-T1 (P4), CCD, QV, SLP - sites did not burn

topography
- Created polygons around each burn and control prairie in ArcGIS Pro
- Downloaded topography raster (DEM) from The National Map (3DEP) with 10m resolution (10 m x 10 m = 100 m2 on the ground): https://index.nationalmap.gov/arcgis/rest/services/3DEPElevationIndex/MapServer (includes elevation, slope, and aspect)
- Clipped raster to the prairie perimeters
- Used Zonal Statistics
